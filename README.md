# sentinel-project

No longer working on this.
It was just a prototype due to the fact that it used web-scraping heavily to obtain data.
(Probably not a great idea to use so much CPU resources on the users device).

I have since moved all of the web scraping to Server Side and built a REST api around it.
I am currently working on Sentinel V2.

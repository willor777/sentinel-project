- Finish scraper methods
-- They need to have the data processed. Decide what type of data you want out of each method,
-- then convert to usable data structure

- Add functionality to Advanced chart
-- Basic candle measuring techs
-- Maybe put indicator methods here (I still think you should make a data class for each Indicator
-- then in the Advanced chart, just make methods that return the Indicator data class)


- Add test in the MiscData.getFuturesData() method to verify Yfinance's list order hasn't changed
-- Example... assert(FuturesData.sp500Future.ticker == ES=F)
